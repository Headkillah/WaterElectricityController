# WaterElectricityController
This is a mod for Cities:Skylines that controls the water and electricity budget automatically based on consumption rates. 

This is my first code in C# and my first mod for Cities:Skylines (or any game).  It is currently in beta and users should apply it at their own risk.  It's very possible for the controller to become unstable at this time, until I can find time to do some actual system analysis and proper tuning adjustments.
